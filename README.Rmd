# rbentures

A debenture is a type of debt security issued by a company to raise capital from investors, promising to pay a fixed rate of interest over a specified period of time. **debentures.com.br**  ([linked phrase](http://www.debentures.com.br/)) is a Brazilian website that provides information and resources related to debentures. In its website we can find a vast number of datasets regarding prices and transactions for debentures available such as:

- Future Events (coupon, amortization etc)
- Issuing Price
- Historical Prices
- Duration

Package rbentures uses webscraping tools to download and read these datasets from **debentures.com.br**, making it easy to consume it in R in a structured way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rbentures from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jvpigozzo/rbentures")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
